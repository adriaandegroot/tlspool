The current usage of TLS relies on centralized certificate authorities which poses a single point of failure and introduces unnecessary costs for signing of certificates. Within this research several existing techniques are used to build a TLS tunneling daemon that validates TLS certificates in a decentralized way. DANE will be used to validate domain certificates by matching them to the certificates stored in DNS. User certificates will be validated using a LDAP server as a PGP key server. By matching the certificates stored in this LDAP server, the client identity can be validated as well. Combining both techniques in a single daemon will allow existing applications, by using small library, to make use of the daemon and establish a reliable and secure TLS connection.
