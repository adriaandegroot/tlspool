/* tlspool/handler.c -- Setup and validation handler for TLS session */

/* This module hosts TLS handlers which treat an individual connection.
 *
 * Initially, the TLS setup is processed, which means validating the
 * connection.  If and when this succeeds, a continued process is needed
 * to encrypt and decrypt traffic while it is in transit.
 *
 * Every TLS connection (including the attempt to set it up) is hosted in
 * its own thread.  This means that it can abide time to wait for user input
 * of PINs.  It also means a very clear flow when the time comes to destroy
 * a connection.
 *
 * While encrypting and decrypting traffic passing through, the thread
 * will use its own poll() call, and thus offload the potentially large
 * one of the main thread, which is supposed to be a low-traffic task.
 * The set of file descriptors used by the session-handler threads are
 * in contrast very small and can easily be started for every single
 * packet passing through.
 *
 * Might the user terminate a process while this one is waiting for a
 * callback command request, then the main TLS pool thread will take
 * care of taking down this thread.  To that end, it sets the followup
 * pointer that normally holds a callback response to NULL, and then
 * permits this thread to run again.  This will lead to a shutdown of
 * this process, and proper closing of all connections.  The remote peer
 * will therefore see the result of a local kill as a connection reset.
 *
 * In case one of the end points of the connection is terminated, a
 * similar thing will happen; the thread will terminate itself after
 * a cleanup of any outstanding resources.  This, once again, leads
 * to passing on the reset of a connection between the encrypted and
 * side of the connection.
