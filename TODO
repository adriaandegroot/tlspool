There are many ways in which the current TLS Pool can be improved:

- Graylist callbacks, preferrably by the application, with generic fallback
- Support for UDP and SCTP and not just TCP
- Application-specific support, with things like mod_tlspool and HTTP proxy
- Support for all of X.509, OpenPGP, PSK and SRP schemes
- Extension of GnuTLS' PKCS #11 support to OpenPGP, PSK and SRP
- TOFU callbacks and storage (where?) of (signed?) acceptance
- Incorporate session resumption (on both ends) (how to safely store creds?)
- Key derivation with the PRF functionality of TLS 1.2
