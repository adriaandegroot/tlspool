README for tlspool/testdata
===========================

This directory holds test data, with barren private keys.  The keys are
useful while testing with _file primitives.

TLS Pool will at some point abandon the file-based versions, and move
them to PKCS #11.  For testing purposes, a SoftHSMv2 database will
be included with the credentials to use then.

The TLS Pool project funds GnuTLS to ensure PKCS #11 support for the
following mechanisms:

 * X.509, was already taken care of before TLS Pool started
 * GnuPG, according to http://openfortress.nl/doc/spec/pgp-in-pkcs11/
 * KDH, as described on http://tls-kdh.arpa2.net
 * SRP, at least the password and if possible also the DH-ish calculations
