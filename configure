17-02-2016: Major improvement in build stability: Dropped autotools.

   Since their introduction in this project, the autotools have shown to be too
   complex.  I really tried to get hold of the underlying architecture and to
   make peace with their grand design.  But all I ran into were here-and-now
   fixes that had to be made, depending on the platform and its installed
   autotools.  A last resort, namely pre-installing ./configure and Makefile.in
   only brought more of that distracting attention to a part of the software
   that ought to just work.  It is time for a remedy, which is to remove the
   autotools from the project and rely on good old Makefile again.  We should
   never have made them unreadable anyway.

You may proceed with

make all && \
make install
